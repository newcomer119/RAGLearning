Depending on your installation method, this can be a load balancer or a port exposed on the host machine.\\n\\u200bServices\\nServiceDescription LangSmith frontendThe frontend uses Nginx to serve the LangSmith UI and route API requests to the other servers. This serves as the entrypoint for the application and is the only component that must be exposed to users. LangSmith backendThe backend is the main entrypoint for CRUD API requests and handles the majority of the business logic for the application. This includes handling requests from the frontend and SDK, preparing traces for ingestion, and supporting the hub API. LangSmith queueThe queue handles incoming traces and feedback to ensure that they are ingested and persisted into the traces and feedback datastore asynchronously, handling checks for data integrity and ensuring successful insert into the datastore, handling retries in situations such as database errors or the temporary inability to connect to the database. LangSmith platform backendThe platform backend is another critical service that primarily handles authentication, run ingestion, and other high-volume tasks. LangSmith playgroundThe playground is a service that handles forwarding requests to various LLM APIs to support the LangSmith Playground feature. This can also be used to connect to your own custom model servers. LangSmith ACE (Arbitrary Code Execution) backendThe ACE backend is a service that handles executing arbitrary code in a secure environment. This is used to support running custom code within LangSmith.\\n\\u200bStorage services\\nLangSmith will bundle all storage services by default. You can configure it to use external versions of all storage services. In a production setting, we strongly recommend using external storage services.\\nServiceDescription ClickHouseClickHouse is a high-performance, column-oriented SQL database management system (DBMS) for online analytical processing (OLAP).LangSmith uses ClickHouse as the primary data store for traces and feedback (high-volume data).💡 Connect to external ClickHouse PostgreSQLPostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.LangSmith uses PostgreSQL as the primary data store for transactional workloads and operational data (almost everything besides traces and feedback).💡 Connect to external PostgreSQL - AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL, Azure Database RedisRedis is a powerful in-memory key-value database that persists on disk.
